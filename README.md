# Weather-Dashboard


This webpage displays the weather forecast for different cities. When a user enters a city name into a form input, they are presented with the city's current and future weather conditions. The current conditions include the current date, the city's current temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and an icon representing the city's current weather conditions. The UV index is color coded to indicate that conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. The forecast presents temperature, wind speed, and humidity projections for the next 5 days, and icons representing the forecasted weather conditions. After a user searches for a city it is saved into local storage, and in a list of buttons on the left side of the page so the user can easily search that city again.
